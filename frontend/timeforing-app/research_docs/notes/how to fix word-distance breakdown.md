eeeeee is compared to apple because eeeeee is longer and canvas is flipped to account, but there is still bullshit



solution

don't compare with the longest string eeeeee instead make apple as long as eeeeee by adding spaces to the end, then we can run the same comparison each time and don't have to flip the canvas.


hopefully this will completely remove all the bullshit
